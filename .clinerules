# Cline Rules for PureScript MCP Server Project

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Develop a Node.js based MCP server to extend Cline's capabilities for PureScript projects.
- **Initial Focus:** Boilerplate server, basic "echo" tool, Memory Bank setup.

## Key Technical Decisions & Patterns
- **Server Technology:** Node.js with Express.js for HTTP handling (initial assumption for MCP).
- **Memory Bank:** Core set of Markdown files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are mandatory and must be kept up-to-date.
- **MCP Configuration:** `mcp-config.json` will be used for server and tool registration.
- **PureScript Interaction:** Initially minimal, with a `purescript-test-examples` directory for future use and basic validation.

## Workflow Preferences
- **Memory Bank First:** Always ensure Memory Bank files are created/updated before significant code changes or when context shifts.
- **Iterative Development:** Build components step-by-step, starting with the simplest viable version.
- **Clear Next Steps:** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` should clearly outline pending tasks.
- **Git Workflow:**
    - The primary branch for this project is `main`.
    - All new work should be committed to `main` and pushed to `origin/main`.
    - The remote repository is `ssh://git@ssh.bitbucket.juspay.net/~avinash.verma_juspay.in/purescript-tools-mcp.git`.

## Documentation Strategy
- **`INSTALL.md`:** Provides general installation instructions for any user/developer wanting to set up the server from scratch (includes cloning). This is the single source of truth for installation.
- **Memory Bank:** Core project context, decisions, and progress are tracked in the `memory-bank/` directory.

## Tool Usage Patterns
- `write_to_file`: Used for creating new files (like Memory Bank docs, initial code files, documentation).
- `execute_command`: Used for `npm init`, `npm install`, running the server, and Git operations.
- `replace_in_file`: Preferred for modifying existing files once they are created.

## Important Reminders for Cline
- **Memory Reset:** My memory is reset between sessions. The Memory Bank and `INSTALL.md` (for understanding setup if needed) are CRUCIAL for re-orienting myself to this project.
- **File Paths:** All paths are relative to the project root (`/Users/avinash.verma/Juspay/what-is-purs`).
- **User Confirmation:** Wait for user confirmation after each tool use.
- **`mcp-config.json` Structure:** This file defines how I discover and use the server's tools.
- **PureScript Tooling:** `purs ide` interaction is a core feature.
- **Installation Prompts:**
    - For any user/developer (including a new AI instance or myself if setting up from scratch): The prompt must include the `git clone` command and direct them to `INSTALL.md`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Established `main` as the primary Git branch.
- Consolidated installation instructions into a single `INSTALL.md` file.
- Successfully configured and pushed to the Bitbucket remote.
